# Task 1: Cloning and Forking
1. Cloning a Repository
Choose a public GitHub repository of interest (for example Ecommerce with Django).

2. Open a git bash and clone the repository: using git clone commad


3. Explore the repository's structure, files, and history:

cd tensorflow
ls
git log --oneline

#  Forking a Repository

* Go to the repository page on GitHub and click the "Fork" button at the top right.

On the top right of the repository page, you'll find a "Fork" button.

Click it. This creates a copy of the repository under your GitHub account.

3. Clone Your Fork:

Use the same git clone command as before, but with the URL of your fork.

# Task 2: Managing Branches
* Creating and Switching Branches
 git checkout -b feature-update

Switch to the newly created branch:

git checkout feature-update

# 4. Making Changes and Committing:

* Make changes to a file or add a new file:
 
 echo "print('Hello, World!')" > hello.py

* Commit the changes:

   To make changes to a file in your forked repository on GitHub and commit them via the web interface, follow these steps:

    Navigate to Your Forked Repository:

    Go to GitHub and navigate to the forked repository where you want to make changes.

   Locate the File:

   In the repository, locate the file you want to edit (in this case, hello.py). You can find it by browsing through the directory structure.

   Edit the File:

   Click on the file name (hello.py) to open it. Then, click on the pencil icon (ðŸ–‰) at the top right of the file view to enter edit mode.

   Make Your Changes:

   Edit the file content in the text editor. For example, you might change the content to:

git add hello.py
git commit -m "Add hello.py with a print statement"

5. Merging Changes

* Switch back to the main branch:

git checkout main


* Merge the changes from the feature-update branch

git merge feature-update

# Task 3: Handling Conflicts

In your forked repository on GitHub, make changes to the same file (e.g., hello.py) and commit them via the web interface.
Pull the changes to your local machine: usign git pull

# 7. Resolving Conflicts

   Resolving conflicts in Git typically occurs when you have conflicting changes in the same file between different branches.

   Identify the Conflict:

   Git will notify you if there's a conflict during a merge or rebase operation. It will mark the conflicting sections in the file hello.py with special markers like <<<<<<<, =======, and >>>>>>>.

   Open the File:

   Open hello.py in a text editor. Look for the conflict markers (<<<<<<<, =======, >>>>>>>) and the conflicting changes between them.

   Resolve the Conflict:

   Decide how to merge the conflicting changes. You may want to keep some parts, discard others, or modify them to create a unified version.

  Remove Conflict Markers:
   
  Delete the conflict markers (<<<<<<<, =======, >>>>>>>) and ensure the file looks correct after merging the changes.

Save the File:

  Save the changes to hello.py in your text editor.

  Add and Commit the Resolved File:

  After resolving the conflict, add the modified hello.py file to the staging area and commit the merge resolution:

 Create a new branch to resolve the conflic using this command:

 git checkout -b conflict-resolution

 Resolve the conflict manually in the file (edit hello.py to resolve the differences).

 Commit the changes and merge the branch back into main:

git add hello.py
git commit -m "Resolve conflict in hello.py"
git checkout main
git merge conflict-resolution

# Task 4: GitHub Pages
Enabling GitHub Pages

Create a simple HTML file

 <!DOCTYPE html>
 <html lang="en">
    
 <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>GitHub Pages</title>
 </head>
 <body>
    <h1>Hello, GitHub Pages!</h1>
 </body>
 </html>

  2. commit and push the file:

     git add index.html
     git commit -m "Add index.html for GitHub Pages"
     git push origin main

  * Enable GitHub Pages in the repository settings:
 * Go to the repository on   GitHub.
 *  Click on "Settings."

  ![alt text](<Screenshot 2024-06-23 132049.png>)

   Scroll down to the "GitHub Pages" section.

 *  Select the source branch (main) and save.

 9. Accessing the Published Page:

  - Visit the GitHub Pages URL for your repository and verify that the HTML file is accessible online.

  Task 5: Open Source Exploration

10. Exploring Open Source Projects

  Search for an open-source project on GitHub related to your interests (e.g., Django).

  Explore the project's documentation, issues, and contribution guidelines.
11. Opening an Issue

    Open a new issue in the chosen open-source project, suggesting an improvement, reporting a bug, or asking for clarification.

    # Challenges:
    * Forgetting to switch branches before making changes can lead to errors, and accidental branch deletions or loss of branch names can cause confusion.

    * Forgetting to commit and push changes can lead to errors, and accidental loss of changes can cause confusion.

    * Forgetting to resolve conflicts can lead to errors, and accidental loss of changes can cause confusion.

    # mitigations
    * Have a good understanding of Git commands and workflows.

    * Double-check commands before executing them to avoid mistakes.

    * Communicate and collaborate effectively with team members or peers when working on shared repositories.

    * Regularly review Git documentation and best practices.
